This is intended to become a test of the daphnia model, developed from examples in quant/quant_pfilter_complete.ipynb and quant/quant_test_simulate.ipynb.

Initial testing revealed some incompatible development between pfilter, pfilter_pf and pfilter_complete.
It doesn't make much sense for pypomp to have these three, highly similar, highly duplicating, functions.

This quant test can be continued once that is fixed.
