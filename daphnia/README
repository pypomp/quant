This is intended to become a test of the daphnia model, developed from examples in quant/quant_pfilter_complete.ipynb and quant/quant_test_simulate.ipynb using
```
quarto convert quant_pfilter_complete.ipynb # converts to qmd
```

This is a working document, representing progress to date on implementing this model, and testing pfilter_complete

The html can be rendered by
```
make
```
or
```
make report.html
```
once quarto is installed.
