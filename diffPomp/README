This is a version of the code used for the original IFAD arXiv paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03085v1

It amounts to a very stripped down version of pypomp.

The purpose of putting it in the pypomp quant tests is to get benchmarking estimates of the overhead due to the package strucure, such as the object-oriented framework of classes and methods.

Set up a new venv, since this old code may need different package versions

Using a python3.10 version. It is not yet clear if this helps; this should be retested when everything else is in working order.

```
deactivate
cd ~/git/quant/diffPomp
rm -rf .diffPomp
python3.10 -m venv .diffPomp
source ~/git/quant/diffPomp/.diffPomp/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade pip 
pip install -U jax
pip install matplotlib==3.8
pip install seaborn==0.11.0 ## for ptitprince compatibility
pip install ptitprince

pip install tqdm
pip install jupyter
pip install toolz
pip install tensorflow_probability
pip install pyreadr

export QUARTO_PYTHON=".diffPomp/bin/python"
make -B cholera.html

```


At some point, one could try python3.11, e.g.,

```
deactivate
cd ~/git/quant/diffPomp
rm -rf .diffPomp
python3.11 -m venv .diffPomp
source ~/git/quant/diffPomp/.diffPomp/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -U jax

pip install matplotlib==3.9
pip install seaborn==0.11.0 ## for ptitprince compatibility
pip install tqdm
pip install jupyter
pip install ptitprince
pip install toolz
pip install tensorflow_probability
pip install pyreadr

```
